# Spitler_CSCI22_FinalProject
My project is a binary tree for storing athletes by stats. For each different stat there will be a binary tree of players for that stat creating an organized structure for players no matter which stat you want to organize them by. You can output for a range of stats between two numbers based on rank of each player with that stat or display all athletes within certain range of values of stat. Finally it allows you to search through the athletes and display each athleteâ€™s stats

As of right not all athletes must have the same number of stats limiting vs offense and defense positons.
