# Spitler_CSCI22_FinalProject

installation guide
download main, header, cpp and text file into one file and then run main

if in codeblocks you need to right click the project name click build options then select the check box that says "have g++ follow the coming C++0x ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++0x]"

Project is a sports player handler

each player has a vector of stats that is parallel to other players vectors so that the stats labels at the same at every index
  stats have labels values and red
for each new stat label a red black binary tree is made to hold all stats of the label/ occur at the vector index
The program then does things like calculate mean standard deviation for all index in the vector prints range; 

players are stored in hashtable for easy access]

Things i though about doing but didnt get to you
in the header you see a struct for a team I built head I never got to creating it but it would be cool if a graph of teams was added to by project with the edges connecting teams that have played against each other

curl downloader for players im still working on this i dont know if ill have it up and running anytime soons however

a strut of positions that contains vector of sports so that you can separate out players better from which stats they will have and which stat they wont have
