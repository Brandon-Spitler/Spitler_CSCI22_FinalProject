# Spitler_CSCI22_FinalProject
Project is a sports player handler

each player has a vector of stats that is parrell to other players vectors so that the stats labels at the same at every index
  stats have labels values and red
for each new stat label a red black bianrary tree is made to hold all stats of the label/ occur at the vector index
The program then does things like calclaut mean standard devatoin for all index in the vector prints range; 

players are strored in hashtable for easy access]

Things i though about doing but didnt get to you
in the header you see a struct for a team i builod i never got to creating it but it would be cool if a graph of teams was added to by project with the edges connecting teams that have played against each other

curl downloader for players im still working on this i dont know if ill have it up and running anytime soons however

a struct of postions that contains vector of sports so that you can sperate out players better from which stats they will have and which stat they wont have
